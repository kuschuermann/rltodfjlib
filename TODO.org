* TODO Test encrypted AES --- fails on SOME files!?!
  "Configuration2/accelerator/current.xml" and "manifest.rdf" fail
  their checksum test BUT inflating them anyway results in a proper
  file ==> IGNORE the checksum and all is well! THIS IS BULLSHIT!
* TODO Test un-encrypted data extraction for ODF 1.0/1.1
* TODO Test un-encrypted data extraction for ODF 1.2
* TODO Test un-encrypted data extraction for OO.o
* TODO Test encrypted data extraction for OO.o
* TODO Re-encrypt AES encrypted document using Blowfish, instead
* TODO Add CLI interface to extract contents of an ODF (decrypt & unzip)
  Default operation: List

  -x to Extract

  -D to Diagnose --- Diagnostics should give information on the data
  extracted from the XML, list the salt/initVector/etc. in either
  Base64 or Hexadecimal notation, etc.

  Would it make sense to create a "diagnostic instruction pipe", e.g.
  instructions such as "decrypt, inflate" or "inflate, decrypt" to
  determine processing order and success/failure info on applying the
  checksum test at each stage?

* TODO Ensure that the GPL3 preamble is in all sources
* TODO Official name: "Ringlord Technologies ODF Java Library"
* TODO Complete/polish in-source (JavaDoc) documentation
* TODO Publish!
  Q: Would it make sense to put this on GitHub?
  A: Yes, probably!
 
  Would need to research how to manage such projects, add
  contributors, and maybe even hand over the project to someone else
  in the future.
