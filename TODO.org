* TODO Test encrypted AES --- fails on SOME files!?!
  All are fine except "Configurations2/accelerator/current.xml" &
  "manifest.rdf", which fail their checksum (could it be that the
  checksum is actually bad?)

  Other documents tend to work just fine, so this is either a
  glitch in my document (bad encryption in an earlier version of
  LibreOffice?) or I'm missing something in my algorithm
* TODO Test un-encrypted data extraction for ODF 1.0/1.1

  Q: Would it make sense to put this on GitHub?
  A: Yes, probably!
 
  Would need to research how to manage such projects, add
  contributors, and maybe even hand over the project to someone else
  in the future.
