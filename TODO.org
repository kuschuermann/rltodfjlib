* TODO Test encrypted AES --- fails on SOME files!?!
  Not certain if this is a bug in LibreOffice, or evidence of
  retardation on my part, but "Configuration2/accelerator/current.xml"
  and "manifest.rdf" fail their checksum test EVEN THOUGH ignoring the
  failed checksum, and inflating them anyway results in perfectly good
  files!

  /me yanks at hair, considers the benefits of alcoholism.

* TODO Test un-encrypted data extraction for ODF 1.0/1.1
* TODO Test un-encrypted data extraction for ODF 1.2
* TODO Test un-encrypted data extraction for OO.o
* TODO Test encrypted data extraction for OO.o
* TODO Feature: Re-encrypt AES encrypted document using Blowfish, instead
  This could be used as a stop-gap measure to allow users of older
  software to convert and use documents created by newer software.
* TODO Add CLI interface to extract contents of an ODF (decrypt & unzip)
  These would affect the Test class, which is used as the command line
  entry point in case the .jar is executed from the command line
  rather than being used as an intregral part of another tool.
** TODO Extract 
  -x to Extract

  This could be useful...
** TODO Diagnose
  -D to Diagnose --- Diagnostics should give detailed information on
  the data extracted from the XML, list the salt/initVector/etc. in
  either Base64 and/or Hexadecimal notation, etc.

  Would it make sense to create a "diagnostic instruction pipe", e.g.
  instructions such as "decrypt, inflate" or "inflate, decrypt" to
  determine processing order and success/failure info on applying the
  checksum test at each stage?
* TODO Ensure that the GPL3 preamble is in all sources
* TODO Complete/polish in-source (JavaDoc) documentation
* TODO Publish!
