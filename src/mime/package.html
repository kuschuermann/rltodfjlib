<p>An extract from a larger package, only the Base64 class is
  currently provided here in order to support transformation of
  arbitrary (binary) data to a 7-bit safe encoding and back again.</p>

<p>Base64 shifts the 24 bits bits of 3 consecutive bytes such that
  they occupy 4 bytes but each of these is mapped to one of 64 common
  and well-defined latin characters (the Base64 alphabet). The result
  is generally safe from all character mapping and formatting errors,
  which has made Base64 the standard for transmitting binary data in
  email, XML, and other encapsulation formats.</p>

<p>Please note that if the data to be transformed is original in
  character form, it is strongly suggested to use UTF-8 to map the
  characters to bytes, rather than relying on whatever happens to be
  the default on your system, as that can differ from the (default)
  encoding on the destination system, and thus produce unpredictable
  encoding/decoding errors that are not the fault of the Base64
  algorithm.</p>
