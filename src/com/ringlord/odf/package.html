<title>Ringlord Technologies ODF Java Library</title>
<body>
<p>General access (currently read-only) to the OASIS Open Document
  Format container (a .zip file) and its individual file entries. Each
  of the entries can be encrypted, in which case the {@link
  com.ringlord.crypto.Crypto} class comes into play.</p>

<p>A {@link com.ringlord.odf.Test} class is provided to serve as a
  simple command line interface for listing an ODF container's
  contents, and (in the future) extract it, provide diagnostics
  reports, etc.</p>

<p>When a {@link com.ringlord.odf.Container} is instantiated, the
  container's manifest (stored in the "META-INF/manifest.xml" file) is
  parsed to locate cryptographical information related to each
  entry. The Container then offers each {@link com.ringlord.odf.Entry}
  for inspection. If an Entry is an {@link
  com.ringlord.odf.Entry#isEncrypted() encrypted} one, then it also
  offers {@link com.ringlord.crypto.Crypto cryptographical}
  information (obtained from the manifest.</p>

<h3>Sample Usage</h3>

<p>The following sample code demonstrates how a file named "test.odt"
  can be read, and all of its entries listed by name; afterwards the
  entry named "content.xml" is obtained, and its data is retrieved; if
  this entry is encrypted, the password 'test' is supplied:</p>

<pre>
  Container odf = new Container( new File("test.odt") );
  try
    {
      for( Entry item : odf )
        {
          System.err.println( "\t" + item );
        }
      final Entry body = odf.get( "content.xml" );
      if( body != null )
        {
          System.err.println( "Found the 'content.xml' entry" );
          final byte[] data = (body.isEncrypted()
                               ? body.data("test") // "test" is the password
                               : body.data());
          if( data != null ) // it's a file, not a directory?
            {
              System.err.println( "Here is the XML:\n" + new String(data) );
            }
        }
    }
  finally
    {
      odf.close();
    }
</pre>
