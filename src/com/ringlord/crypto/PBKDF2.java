/**
 * <p>
 * Implements the "PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1" algorithm according to RFC&nbsp;2898.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unlike the standard Java crypto library's
 * {@link javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec} this implementation allows for
 * byte[]-based passwords and is not limited to UTF-8 encoded char[].
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This implementation was, in fact, developed specifically to deal with
 * encrypted (password protected) OASIS Open Document Format files whose
 * encryption does not begin with passing a password to the PBKDF2 algorithm,
 * but an SHA1-hash thereof, necessitating an implementation of PBKDF2 that
 * accepts binary data.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * I would like to offer my thanks to the following people for their various
 * input, all of which in combination not merely encouraged me to continue
 * seeking a solution to this problem, but led me on a path of discovery into
 * the complex field cryptography that resulted ultimately in the creation of
 * the Ringlord Technologies ODF Java Library of which this code is a part:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>Steven Elliot, whose lucid description as well as scripts and software to
 * decrypt OOo documents explained two crucial pieces that had eluded me before:
 * The use of SHA1 on the password (which explained why the standard Java
 * library didn't work), and the fact that the header/footer on the compressed
 * data need to be reconstructed.
 * <li>Matthias G&auml;rtner, whose PBKDF2 package forms the basis for our code,
 * <li><i>sabre150</i>, prolific, and unforgivingly sarcastic expert from the
 * Sun Forums who offers hints and advise but refuses to provide solutions for
 * those who don't even understand what they are doing: in cryptography,
 * muddling about leads to poor (and therefore terribly bad, even dangerous)
 * "solutions".
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Now, OASIS Open Document Files are protected using passwords as follows:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ol>
 * 
 * <li>User-entered passwords are run through SHA1 or SHA256 to produce a 160
 * bit (20 byte) or 256 bit (32 byte) value; The (binary) password is then
 * turned via PBKDF2 algorithm into a secret key: As Steven Elliot remarks, the
 * first step is rather redundant as PBKDF2 performs SHA1/SHA256 on the password
 * 1024 times (in the case of OpenOffice.org's use of PBKDF2) but a digest
 * algorithm is also a convenient way to map arbitrarily long passwords to the
 * digest-sized data that PBKDF2 begins with (in other words, there actually is
 * a method to the madness!)
 * 
 * <li>The (XML) document is compressed/deflated (see RFC&nbsp;1950,
 * RFC&nbsp;1951, and RFC&nbsp;1952), the 10-byte header (magic number, version
 * number, and timestamp) as well as the 8-byte footer (CRC-32 checksum and
 * original file's size) are stripped away; the resulting body is then encrypted
 * using the 128-bit "Blowfish/CFB/NoPadding" or 256-bit "AES/CBC/NoPadding"
 * cipher, combined with a randomly generated initialization vector.
 * 
 * <li>The CRC-32, salt, initialization vector, iteration count (1024), and
 * cipher (Blowfish/CFB or AES/CBC), are all described in the document's
 * meta-data (the manifest).
 * 
 * </ol>
