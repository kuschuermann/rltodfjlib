<title>Ringlord Technologies ODF Java Library</title>
<body>
<p>A pure Java library intended to provide simple access to the
  contents of OASIS Open Document File (ODF) containers, meaning that
  you can use this library as the basis for extracting either plain
  text or encrypted (password protected) elements from an ODF
  file.</p>

<h3>Lost your password?</h3>

<p>Some may be tempted to believe that this library can magically
  offer recovery of lost passwords. <em>That is not the case!</em>
  Although some fundamental weaknesses exist in the way that ODF uses
  encryption, based on the fact that the encrypted files are XML and
  the first ~43 bytes of the original data are predictably the same
  and thus offer pattern analysis hints to a dedicated cryptanalyst,
  such analysis is generally beyond the abilities of the general
  public, is certainly beyond my own abilities, and completely outside
  the scope of this library.</p>

<p>If you have lost your password, the best that this library can hope
  to offer you is to form the basis for a tool that would allow you to
  try brute-force attacks that are faster than typing countless
  password attempts into a word processor.</p>
